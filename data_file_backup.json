      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA.

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA.

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies and interests I did not know I had. \r\nThis year I got very into learning how to code computers, developing my first software program after taking classes in the Design School. \r\nThis summer I will continue to learn during Coding Academy, a summer program that offers intensive courses in software engineering. \r\nI am enjoying stimulating this side of my brain. I came to college as a music major, \r\nI have played the piano for 14 years, and surprisingly the two complement each other very well. \r\nI hope to continue both interests during my last two years in University. ",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also very simple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "In college, I was involved with the organizing of various community outreach programs and charitable institutions. By biggest accomplishment in this realm was founding Parish Tutoring, an organization that engages college students in mentoring high school students from the community. In my three years with the organization our group mentored over 80 students, 80% of these students have matriculated to a four-year college or university.\r\n\r\nIn my spare time, I love taking pictures. I have even documented many university events as part of my artistic practice. Working hand in hand with others has surely stood out to me as a passion in my life. I enjoy collaborating with others, artistically through photography and most certainly, through mentorship. I look forward to continuing to develop these skills and passions through this opportunity.\r\n",
      "ton_of_work": "Once in my college life, i was gone through this kind of situation.\r\nThere was lot of work to do. I'm carrom secretory and we had a sports event zest.\r\nI had to work on our project and as well as to study for placement process and academic schedule was there too.\r\nAs a secretory, I had to do lot of work regarding event, publicity and scheduling.\r\nTo get through this lot of work, what i first did was a plan. I planned everything. I did all project work in all day time with \r\nacademic classes. Practiced carrom at evening and studied after practice till 1:00 am. Distrubuted work among team players.I took proper sleep of 6 hours each day to keep me fresh.\r\nIt was really a hell lot of work but i did it. \r\n",
      "difficult_time": "Although my life is simple .But sometime I found myself in difficult situation.Like In college I was not very confident guy and had my inferiority complex in me.Getting over it  and become assertive in my job is big thing.\r\nTalking to girl is another.When I wanted to have conversation with girl ,I had to make script in my mind about what to talk about.Even sometime I motivated myself for hours to have just a casual talk.\r\n \r\nNow I think I changed my thinking process about the things or I can say I become more mature.I am ready to take risk  and face the consequences of each and every step.My reading of self help books and inspiration material also helped (But I donot recommend anyone to rely  completly on  self help books).I started taking initiatives in every area of my life.I also realised that fear is just a thing in mind,reality is not that bad.e.g.  My fear of talking to girls was went away ,when I started doing those things.It is also verysimple to get over fear,do things which you fear and fear goes away. ",
      "team_player": "\"Yes I am. An example of this was with my summer internship team, the Global Standards Project, where we were all working together with a variety of background and skills to produce a result which none of us could have achieved individually. It's important to note that I joined an already established team, so it was important to me to communicate with others and make sure I was on track for delivering my part of the project. Although my deliverable was a small part of the overall project, there were several team dependencies based on my ability to deliver. So I not only kept everyone current during the weekly meetings, I also worked closely with several key team members throughout the week to make sure I kept my portion of the project on track. The end result is that I delivered on time and within budget. The entire project met its deliverables and they are now on to the next phase of the project.\" ",
      "book": "what i would like to suggest is Mrityunjay. Mrityunjay is a fictional novel very famous in the marathi compositions . It is based on Karna, a great warrior in the epic of Mahabharata. The novel comprises auspicious Marathi writing skills as well as the figures of speech used in the writing is much interesting and hence this novel has got fame in the minds of people. The artistic language is very simple and dealing with the beauties of nature.This novel proves a milestone in the history of Marathi novels yet standing still in this century and it is awarded with many of the prizes and awards given by the Jnanpith (Murti Devi Award).\r\nMost of the people got acquainted with the mahabharata through the popular sitcom. And whatever books were dedicated to the subject concentrated on accentuating the plight of pandavas and continued condemnation of duryodhana (suyodhana). MRITUNJAY scores high not only by providing the point of view of each and every prominent person but also maintaining a neutral tone. KARNA remains the most mysterious and intriguing character of Mahabharta, mritunjay delves inside the anals of history plundering and conjuring bits and scrapes of detailed info,merging it into a action-cum-drama saga. On completing the book,i found my view point about the great war altered and even an insensitive jerk like me was moved by the sufferings of KARNA. IF you love mythology and wouldnt mind an encore of the story with a fresh narration and perspective,Mrityunjay is the book for you.",

      "about_yourself": "Despite having the appearance of a child, Meliodas is actually much older, being over three thousand years old. He is exceptionally short compared to other characters, with messy blond hair and a pair of emerald green eyes. He also lacks facial hair, further accentuating his adolescent appearance. Regardless of his stature and youthful looks, he is relatively muscular, possessing an array of well-developed abdominal muscles. He is often shown wearing an ordinary, clean white button-front shirt and a black sleeveless vest on top with a loosely worn tie. His Broken Sword's scabbard is held on by a green leather belt with gold-colored buckles. Without any socks, he wears a pair of black boots. His most distinctive trait is his Dragon symbol carved at the top of his left arm, just below his shoulders.\r\n\r\nDuring his tenure as the leader of Danafor's Holy Knights, Meliodas wore their traditional armor, much like Cain Barzad's. Ten years ago he wore a full-body silver armor with a unique helmet, like the rest of the Sins. He also wielded a dagger that appeared to be his Sacred Treasure. Meliodas was issued a wanted poster, like all of the Sins were after being framed for the murder of Great Holy Knight Zaratras. The most current issue of his wanted poster did not accurately depict him at all but did strangely resemble Estarossa, Meliodas' (presumably older) brother.",

      "about_yourself": "A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks the ninja village Konoha. In response, the leader of Konoha – the Fourth Hokage – seals the fox inside his newborn son Naruto Uzumaki at the cost of his life. As a child, Naruto is isolated from the Konoha community, who regards him as if he was the Nine-Tails itself and treat him with hostility. A decree made by the current Hokage, the Third Hokage, forbids anyone mentioning the Nine-Tails to anyone else to prevent Naruto from finding out the truth. Twelve years later, renegade ninja Mizuki reveals the truth to Naruto before being defeated by him with the Shadow Clone Jutsu, earning the respect of his teacher Iruka Umino. Shortly after, Naruto becomes a ninja and is assigned alongside Sasuke Uchiha, whom he often competes against, and Sakura Haruno, whom he has a crush on, to form a three-person team named Team 7 under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 is charged with completing missions requested by villagers, ranging from doing chores, and being bodyguards or executing assassinations.\r\n\r\nAfter several missions, most notably one to the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to participate in a ninja exam in which they can advance to a higher rank, and thus take part in more difficult missions. During the exams, Orochimaru, a top-wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage in an act of revenge. This forces one of the three legendary ninja, Jiraiya, to search with Naruto for Tsunade, who has been nominated to become the Fifth Hokage. During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru desires to acquire Sasuke due to his powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan. He also wants to use Sasuke as a vessel; he believes he can become immortal this way, sealing his soul inside of Sasuke's body. Believing Orochimaru will be able to give him the strength needed to kill his older brother Itachi, who destroyed their clan, Sasuke eventually joins him after a humiliating defeat at his brother's hands. Tsunade sends a group of ninja including Naruto to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to bring him back to the village.",
